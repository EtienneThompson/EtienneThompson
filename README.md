- I'm currently working on [etiennethompson.com](http://etiennethompson.com) and a series of subdomain sites which will comprise an ecosystem of apps I've made and use.
- I'm currently learning web stacks, like react, vuejs, typescript, django, SQL databases, and cloud hosting. I've been really enjoying the web development I've been doing but still have a lot to learn!
